        <h1>Welcome to the Dream Teams Game Project!!</h1>
            <p>&emsp; This project is for ITEC 2351 Web Fundamentals</p>
        <h2>What kind of game is this?</h2>
            <p>The game for this project is a simple game of hangman!
                <br>&emsp; To learn about the game and its rules check out the link menu for rules!</p>
        <h3>Why make a game based on hangman?</h3>
                <p>&emsp; The reason why we made a web-based game of hangman is to practice our knowledge and expertise in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                     <br>But the most important reason why we created this game is because its fun.</p>
